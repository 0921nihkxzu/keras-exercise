meik added to tf env path by adding the file meik.pth with the path to meik into the folder ~/anaconda3/envs/tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/

updating usb disks with copy of repo via:
rsync -r ../meik/ /media/markus/9414-678D/meik/
rsync -r ../meik/ /media/markus/disk/meik/

standardization served as a good example of what seems like a nice way to structure the code going from high level to low:
- model has a standardization object with high level functions for where it needs to be called
- standardization object produces a standardization depending on the type provided on initialization by the model
- basic functions for calculating normalizations are located in utilities

Note to self: make commits to git more frequently!!!
