- implemented grad check - done
	- bug 1: updated weights after calculating derivatives thus numerical gradients were being calculated on updated weights which would obviously be different

- make grad check into function in its own file - Done

- check gradients for:
	- binary_crossentropy - Done
	- regression
	- categorical
	- regularization
