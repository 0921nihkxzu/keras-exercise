An exercise in understanding deep learning and software development by implementing a tool akin to Keras. A sequential model API has been created in models.py; layers such as feedforward neural nets, convolutional networks, dropout, batch normalization have been implemented in layers.py; other aspects such as initalization, regularization, optimizers, normalization, as well as various other utility function can be found.
